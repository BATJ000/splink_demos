    "These are useful for quality assurance purposes because they allow us to understand how our model works and verify that it is doing something sensible.  They can also be useful to identify examples where the model is not performing as expected.  \n",

    "In addition to these spot checks, Splink also has functions to perform more formal accuracy analysis.  These functions allow you to understand the likely prevalence of false positives and false negatives in your linkage models.\n",
